DRAG & DRIFT GAME PROTOTYPE OVERVIEW
The basic idea is that you have to drag your finger across the screen while the car is following it. 
This is the main difference between my game and the competitors. The prototype only has one simple map. 
The car can only move along the road because the road is bound between two static physics bodies. 
Whenever the car tries to go outside the road, it bumps into the borders making a characteristic sound. 
I have been using Corona SDK and Lua programming language to make the prototype. These tools are quite easy to learn. 
Also Corona makes it very easy to publish for both Android and iOS markets – you don’t have to write 
code specific to the operating system. In the future I plan to make a full-featured game by incorporating
the different physics model for the car which will make the simulation of drifting possible and other cool stuff.
